The simplest nontrivial example of a vector bundle is the Möbius band (pictured on the right): a strip of paper with a twist in it,
 which represents a rank 1 vector bundle over a circle (the circle in question being the centerline of the Möbius band). K-theory is a tool
  for working with higher-dimensional analogues of this example, or in other words for describing higher-dimensional twistings:
   elements of the K-group of a space are represented by vector bundles over it, so the Möbius band represents an element
    of the K-group of a circle

Topological K-theory was discovered by Atiyah and Friedrich Hirzebruch[39] who were inspired by Grothendieck's proof of 
the Grothendieck–Riemann–Roch theorem and Bott's work on the periodicity theorem. This paper only discussed the zeroth K-group;
 they shortly after extended it to K-groups of all degrees,[40] giving the first (nontrivial) example of a generalized cohomology theory.
